Animius is an open source software library for creating deep-learning-powered virtual assistants.
It provides an intuitive workflow that extracts data from existing media (such as anime
and TV shows) and trains on them to provide a personalized AI. The flexible architecture enables you
to add custom functionality to your virtual assistant.

Animius also ships with a high-level API `animius.Console` that allows users without programming 
experience to use Animius.

## Installation

Install the current release from PyPi:
```
pip install animius
```

Then, install Tensorflow (recommended version 1.12). We recommend using the GPU package (`tensorlfow-gpu`)
if you are going to train your own virtual assistant. Read more on Tensorflow installation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

*See [Installing Animius](https://www.animius.org/install) for detailed instructions and Docker installation guide.*
